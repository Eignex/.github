Eignex is building **[Combo](https://github.com/eignex/combo)**, a bandit optimization engine that brings automated, ML-driven tuning to production infrastructure. Whether maximizing **LLM agent efficacy** or refining UI parameters, Combo operates with minimal overhead, available as a self-hosted Kubernetes service or a fully managed platform at [eignex.io](https://eignex.io).

To power this engine, we also build high performance libraries in Kotlin. Check out some of our repos!
